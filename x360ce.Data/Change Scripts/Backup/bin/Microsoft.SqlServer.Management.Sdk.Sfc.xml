            Implementation note:
            This is a temporary implementation of DifferencingService. The implementation should be 
            replaced by MFx "Service" mechanism when it  is due. For now, the only client we are
            attempting to support is Smo. This class look up known Smo Providers using reflection.
            All provider is loaded from Smo's dll.

            This interface defines the Differential Service on SFC and SMO objects. The service walks 
            and compares two specified graphs and returns an Diffgram (IEnumerable&lt;DiffEntry&gt;)
            representing the difference.
            
            It is late-activated, meaning that it does not walk the graphs until the enumerator 
            is accessed.

        <member name="M:Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.Sdk.Differencing.IDifferencer.CompareGraphs(System.Object,System.Object)">
            <summary>
            Compares two  graphs (defined below) 
            and returns the difference.
            
            The result of CompareGraphs represents the difference 
            to be applied to the target to obtain the source. 
            (i.e., target + diff => source) 
            
            To support both SMO and SFC, the input are left as 'object' type. However, it 
            allows only SqlSmoObject or SfcObject. This method throws InvalidArgumentException 
            if the type of the specified objects is invalid.
            
            Two graphs are said to comparable (i.e., have the same type), if they have the same 
            structure at all levels, which means each node has the same type of children and 
            properties. If the specified graphs are not comparable, this method throws 
            InvalidArgumentException.
            
            When a nodes on each graph has the same identity (represented by Urn in both 
            SMO and SFC), it is said to be identical. When two identical nodes have the same 
            values for all Properties, they are  said to be equivalent (disregard the children 
            they have).
            
            During the comparison, this Service will examine all relevant nodes. (The relevance 
            of nodes and properties is domain-specific.) For each pair of identical nodes from both sides, 
            the Service compares all relevent Properties. If the nodes are not equivalent, a 
            DiffEntry with DiffType.Updated are added to the result. The children will then be 
            compared.
            
            When a child appears in the source but not in the target, an DiffEntry with 
            DiffType.Created is added to the result, likewise for DiffType.Deleted.
            
            The Differencer walks the children (of all level) of a Created or Deleted node.
            The children entries are included in the result.
            
            Finally, each pair of identical children is checked for equivalence.
            
            CompareGraphs() scales to very large graphs and does not retain the entire graphs in 
            memory if possible. Applications using this service should not have logic that depends 
            on the ordering of the results, which may be different when the implementation changes 
            in the future for further optimization.
            
            The current implementation walks the tree in late-activate fashion. Resetting the result 
            IEnumerator might result in the graphs being walked again. 
            
            The result IDiffgram is not thread-safe.

             <summary>
             The IDynamicVisible interface should be implemented by any class that wants to limit
             the visibility of certain Enum values based on state of the class at that moment.
            
             If a class contains a property which exposes an Enum and that class implements the
             IDynamicVisible interface then it will be called for each property that is of an Enum type.
            
             The context param can be used to determine for which Enum this method is being called. If a class
             only has one Enum it is not necessary to make this check.
            
             The way to limit the visibility of certain items is to simply remove the unwanted Enum values
             from the values ArrayList. This method is called on every drop down of the enum so it is possible
             to change the list on each and every drop down. If the list will not change once it has been
             initially determined caching the ArrayList and returning it would be helpful.
            
             Care should be taken to ensure that you are not removing values that the Enum property is already
             set to. This will not cause any errors as all Enum values are still valid but when the user clicks
             on the dropdown they will not see the current choice as an option.
            
             Also no new values should be added to the list since these values will not be convertable to valid
             Enum values and an error will be thrown at runtime. If more dynamic control is needed then
             consider using the DynamicValues design.

             Removing items from the values list and returning that new list will control
             the values shown in the Enum specified in context.
            
             The enum can be determined with code similar to the following
                 if (context.PropertyDescriptor.PropertyType == typeof(myEnum))

             The IDynamicValues interface is used to create dynamic lists for string properties. A class

             generation of dynamic values.
            
             This interace and attribute can be used when a list of strings that will not be known until run-time

            Currently we only ask for bulk per DomainContext once, then simply do individual discovery until all nodes have had a discovery pass.
            
            For v2, we would introduce bulk DomainContext Type discovery after doing the DomainContext discovery, and maybe even repeat bulk
            discovery until no new nodes are contributed from it, then resort to individual discovery.
            
            Also we may need to give bulk handlers an iterator, unless we want to rely on handing them acess to the DepEngine
            itself as a sink for adding new nodes discovered as well as traversing directly on the nodes. This is okay as long as we assume (or know)
            that the bulk handlers themselves just make a temp collection to hold the nodes before making the query. They have to be done walking the graph
            before they start adding nodes. Just like any other iterator use, if they try to violate this order and add nodes before they are finished Next'ing
            on the iterator, the iterator will throw (which is what we want to happen).

            The SfcKey class is the base class for all nested Key classes which every SfcInstance-derived object must have.
            It implements equality and hashing but not comparison, since Keys are only required to know if they are equal or not.
            
            Keys are meant to be immutable once constructed, hence a Key should not contain data which can change during the Key object's lifetime.
            Do not use field(s) as part of a Key which are not truly part of the identity the Key represents. We may enforce this by disallowing set()
            on the internal properties for the Key.
            
            Any ordering or collation needs are addressed by implementing:
            1. IComparable on the SfcKey-derived class

             This is tricky since the DataReader we open and allow to live until this iterator object dies will conflict with any

             We leave it to the caller to handle invalid cloning attempts, and to adjust their code to use the iterator to
             cache the results into their own temp collection before proceeding to perform more operations that also need a DataReader.
             
            Also, if we are running in the SQLCLR context connection, we cannot directly clone it and have to make a "loopback" clone connection.

            Basic wrapper implementation of ISfcSimpleNode using reflection.
            
            The data structure is designed to be as non-retaining as possible, meaning that
            the actual objects and wrappers are released as soon as they are not needed. Asking
            for any value from the node might result in different instance being returned. 
            (because the node does not track any of them.)
            
            The class is not thread-safe. Multi-threaded program should start from distinct node.

            This enumeration determines the use of query iterators on object query results. It only applies to queries returning an iterator.
            Caching avoids these issues entirely at the expense of first caching all of the query results in memory.
            Single or multiple active queries both use a non-cached iterator, but affect how the domain instance responds the GetConnection method.
            
            All iterators of query results must always be disposed as soon as they are no longer in use regardless of mode.

        <member name="F:Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.Sdk.Sfc.SfcObjectQueryMode.MultipleActiveQueries">
            A non-cached iterator is desired, but since other queries may be issued on the domain instance's connection while this iterator is still open and in use,
            a more suitable cloned or alternate connection may be used. Assume the domain instance connection is busy with another query even if it currently is not.
