## Custom instructions: GitHub Copilot

With GitHub Copilot, you can receive chat responses tailored to your team'ss workflow, preferred tools, and project specifics.
Instead of adding this contextual detail to each chat query, you can create a file that supplies this information automatically.
While this additional context won't appear in the chat, it is available to GitHub Copilot, allowing it to generate more accurate and relevant responses.

**How to Enable Custom Instructions**

Enable the feature via Tools > Options > GitHub > Copilot > and check (Preview) Enable custom instructions to be loaded from .github/copilot-instructions.md files and added to requests.
Add copilot-instruction.md in the root of your respository inside the .github file, create the file if it doesn't already exist.

### LLM Selection Guideline

If your deployment environment allows, prefer a newer, higher-capacity model—such as Anthropic Claude Sonnet 4 or Google Gemini 2.5 Pro - instead of the current OpenAI GPT 4 lineup.  These frontier models typically deliver stronger reasoning, broader context windows, and more consistent output quality on complex tasks.
