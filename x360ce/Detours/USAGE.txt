Basic usage:

0) Include hde.cpp into your project or create a library from it and statically link it.

1) Define a new type:

typedef int (*tPrintIntegers)(int, int);

Make sure to specify the correct calling convention. On unixes, this is always cdecl.
For WinAPI functions, this is always stdcall.
To define a type with a calling convention use:

typedef int (__cdecl *tPrintIntegers)(int, int);


2) Create a global variable for the class instance (only required if you have to call the original function):

MologieDetours::Detour<tPrintIntegers>* detour_PrintIntegers = NULL;


3) Create the detour function. Its type must match the original function's type.

int hook_PrintIntegers(int param1, int param2)
{
	return detour_PrintIntegers->GetOriginalFunction()(param1, param2);
}


4) Create the detour in your program's initialization routine:

try
{
	detour_PrintIntegers = new MologieDetours::Detour<tPrintIntegers>(PrintIntegers, hook_PrintIntegers);
}
catch(MologieDetours::DetourException &e)
{
	// Handle error
}


5) Remove the detour

delete detour_PrintIntegers;
